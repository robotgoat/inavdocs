# Welcome to the Docs

INAV is a flight controller software for a multitude of air and land vehicles such as multirotors, fixed wings, VTOLs, rovers, and submarines.
The software suite consists of:
* INAV Firmware - what's flashed on the flight controller
* INAV Configurator - a graphical desktop tool that allows for configuring and programming the vehicle
* INAV Lua Widget - an EdgeTX widget that augments the INAV experience 
* INAV Blackbox Tools - a tool to convert and use flight data recorded on the flight controller

## Purpose

This unofficial, community made website is the next evolution for the INAV project's documentation. 
The new documentation aims to consolidate everything INAV in a central and easy to use location.
