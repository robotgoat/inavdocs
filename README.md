# INAV: The New Documentation Project

This project is the new and updated documentation built using Docusaurus V3. 
The current INAV documentation is scattered about in the Github Wiki and the docs directory of the main project. 
This documentation attempts to consolidate all the knowledge about INAV into a centralized, easy to access and read location.

To build and run the docs locally, install npm on your system and follow the Docusaurus installation instructions. 
Run the dev server with `npm run start`
