# INAV: The New Documentation Project

This project is the new and updated documentation built using Docusaurus V3. 
The current INAV documentation is scattered about in the Github Wiki and the docs directory of the main project. 
This documentation attempts to consolidate all the knowledge about INAV into a centralized, easy to access and read location.
