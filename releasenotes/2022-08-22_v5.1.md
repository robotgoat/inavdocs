## Important Notes

### Config wipe mitigation

INAV 5.1 lowers the probablity of a full config wipe on reboot. Bear in mind, technically it's not a bug. When FC is disconnected during EEPROM write, checksum will not updated and INAV will erase flash on next boot as a safety measure. To prevent this from happening, always wait until INAV fully reboots before disconnecting the flight controller.

### Mamba H743 and ZEEZF7 V2 external flash

INAV 5.1 supports 128Mbit W25N01G flash memory that can be found on Mamba H743 and ZEEZF7 V2.

### Horizon Drift mitigation

To improve AHI drift on fixed wings, apply following settings via CLI:

#### For airplanes without a tail (wings, delta, etc)
```
set imu_acc_ignore_rate = 9
set imu_acc_ignore_slope = 5
set nav_fw_pos_z_p = 35
set nav_fw_pos_z_i = 5
set nav_fw_pos_z_d = 10
set nav_fw_pos_xy_p = 70
set imu_dcm_kp = 1000
set imu_dcm_ki = 0
```

#### For airplanes with a tail (dedicated elevator)
```
set imu_acc_ignore_rate = 7
set imu_acc_ignore_slope = 4
set nav_fw_pos_z_p = 25
set nav_fw_pos_z_i = 5
set nav_fw_pos_z_d = 7
set nav_fw_pos_xy_p = 55
set imu_dcm_kp = 1000
set imu_dcm_ki = 0
```
