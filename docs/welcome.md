# Welcome to the Docs

## Purpose

This website is the much needed evolution for the INAV project's documentation. 
The original documentation was scattered about in the official Github repo and its wiki page. 
This split documentation made it messy and cumbersome to quickly reference something as one source might be outdated while the other is actively maintained. 
The new documentation aims to consolidate everything INAV in a central and easy to use location.

## How to Use

:::info
For absolute first timers getting setup, please visit the **Installation** section to get your environment prepared with Inav Configurator. 
:::

The documentation is organized into two main sections: **Quickstart** and **Modules**. 

- **Quickstart** aims to get you from zero to flying with a barebones configuration for an airplane or quadcopter. 
It will not delve into advanced features such as waypoint missions and return to home options. 

- **Modules** will explain in greater detail all the options available with INAV and how to go about configuring your aircraft with INAV Configurator to use them if applicable.
